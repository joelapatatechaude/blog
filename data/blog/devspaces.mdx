# Introduction

We, developers, have evolved over the last decades, to use more and more advanced IDEs on our laptop. In my generation, emacs was a
great option, still used today, probably not by younger generation who will find the like of eclipse, VSCode, or Intellij more appealing.
We also evolved in the number of languages, frameworks, libraries, backend services we need to understand, know, or master. In my age,
being good in one language, say C, C++, or Java was plenty to get any job. Nowadays, the list of technical "must have" and "good to have"
requirements listed in any job add is insane. The rise of the full stack developer, jack of all trades, master of none. This got even
more complicated with the rise of microservices, often written in different languages, different language version, using different
libraries, in different version, relying on different backend services, also in... different versions. Maintaining a development environment
on one's laptop, to cater for this diversity has become a time consuming (wasting?) task, that unnecessary add to the mental load
of developers those days.

I believe, we, developers have been the victims of the so called boiling frog syndrome: A frog dropped inside a pot full
of safe cold water, which temperature has been increased years after years, without the frog sensing the danger of the water
temperature raising to boiling level, until it's too late for that poor amphibian.

I believe it's time to get out of this cooking pot, and fix that once and for all.
Disclaimer: no frogs were hurt in the making of this blog post.

# Containers to the rescue?

Containerized technology enjoy a massive grow over the last decade. By encapsulating all the requirements of a given applications
(think OS, libraries, runtime environment, code), it ensure safe isolation and portability of that application. Unlike Virtual Machine,
that container is a few order of magnitude faster to start, lighter to store, easier to transport, and agile to work with. It is the
supporting technology that has enable the rise of microservices. Containers are now so ubiquitous, they became the defacto
solution for new project, or solution for legacy project in need of modernisation.

This raise the question: If containers are so ubiquitous, if containerized system brings so many benefits, why don't we, developers
use a containerized IDE in the first place?

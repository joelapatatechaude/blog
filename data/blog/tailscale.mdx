Disclaimer: I had no idea how to use Tailscale VPN 2 days ago. It's ridiculously easy.

# TL;DR

Tailscale is becoming incredibly popular as a zero config VPN solution. It's NAT transversal capability make it incredibly easy to
established a secured connection between two machines, both behind a NAT / firewall. Tailscale released last year a kubernetes operator that
make it easy to install and configure on your kubernetes cluster. However, there are a couple of fixes needed to make it OpenShift
compatible out of the box. Until Tailscale implement those small changes, a couple of hacks are required. I didn't find some satisfactory
blog or documetation that tackle this, I though this blog post would help the OpenShift community.

# Tailscale

You will need to create a tailscale network, attached to an account. I Signed up with my personal google account.
Then there should be some instruction to install tailscale on your first machine, your current laptop is a good place to start.
Just follow those steps. Once you have access to the tailscale console, you will need two complete two kubernetes prerequisites,
as explained here: https://tailscale.com/kb/1236/kubernetes-operator#prerequisites :

Configure some kubernetes ACL tags, this link should bring you to the right location in the tailscale admin consoel: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls/file In the doc, they omit the required comma `,` at the end, make sure you add it.
Configure an oauth client, and get a client ID / Secret. This link should bring you at the right place. https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/oauth Store the clientID / secret somewhere, you will need it later.

# Tailscale operator for kubernetes

There is an operator deployable via helm. Finger cross this operator will eventually made available in the OpenShift Operator Hub. For the time being, a manual helm install is required.
At the time of writing, the container image of that Operator (v1.70.0) doesn't meet the OpenShift security requirement, and a small hack is required. Let's get started.

This section documentation gives you some indication on how to install the operator with helm. https://tailscale.com/kb/1236/kubernetes-operator#helm

Unless it’s fixed, chances are the operator won’t deploy nicely without a hack. I am on version 1.70.0 of the chart.

```
cschmitz@fedora:~$ helm search repo tailscale
NAME                        	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
tailscale/tailscale-operator	1.70.0       	v1.70.0    	A Helm chart for Tailscale Kubernetes operator
```

and when the operator is deployed with the `helm upgrade ....` command, chances are the pod will crash quickly, with an error in the log that would look like:

```
mkdir /.config: permission denied
```

This kind of issue is typical of running container images that don’t follow OpenShift best security practices. Those practices are explained here: https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/11/11/best-practices-building-images-pass-red-hat-container-certification?source=sso#best_practice__3__set_group_ownership_and_file_permissions
So really, all that is needed is to precreate this /.config directory, and run the chown / chmod commands explained in the articlue. Hopefully Tailscale will eventually implement this, but for the time being, there are two hacky solution:
Set the UID=0 in the tailscale operator deployment, as suggested here by one of my colleague https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/10638
Build an tailscale operator image based on the tailscale one. That’s the option I went with:

## Hack #1

Build your own image with something like

```Dockerfile
FROM tailscale/k8s-operator:v1.70.0
RUN mkdir /.config
RUN chgrp -R 0 /.config && \
    chmod -R g=u /.config
USER 1001
```

And push it to a container registry. If you trust me (should you?), you could use mine: quay.io/rh_ee_cschmitz/tailscale-ocp-k8s-operator:v1.70.0 but really, don’t use my image, who knows what’s inside apart for me?
Besides, mine is for v1.70.0, and the Tailscale project is moving quickly...

Using that modified image with the helm chart is quite simple, it just needs two extra arg to overwirte the imag repo and image tag (adjust with your image of course, unless you trust me):

```bash
helm upgrade \
  --install \
  tailscale-operator \
  tailscale/tailscale-operator \
  --namespace=tailscale \
  --create-namespace \
  --set-string oauth.clientId=<OAauth client ID> \
  --set-string oauth.clientSecret=<OAuth client secret> \
  --set-string operatorConfig.image.repository=quay.io/rh_ee_cschmitz/tailscale-ocp-k8s-operator \
  --set-string operatorConfig.image.tag=v1.70.0 \
  --wait
```

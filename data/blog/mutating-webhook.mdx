# TL;DR

If you work with Kubernetes, one day, you will have a use case where you need a way to validate or mutate a k8s resource sent to k8s api,
before it gets ingested by k8s. In my case, I want to override all pod cpu requests for the needs of my underspeced OpenShift “lab” cluster.
If you have a similar need, read this post, it will debunk a few assumptions, and give you what you need to get started.
Otherwise, just bookmark this blog post and come back when you are ready.

# Key concepts:

## What are admission controllers?

Quoting the k8s documentation, _“An admission controller is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server
prior to persistence of the object, but after the request is authenticated and authorized. Admission controllers may be validating, mutating, or both.”_

Sounds cool.

I like to think of a validating admission controller like a fancy night club bouncer who checks the kind of shoes you are wearing and decides to let you in, or not.

    height="460"
  />
</figure>

Wearing flip flop (we call them thongs in Australia, how weird) would get you rejected, in other words, **not validated**.

I like to think of a mutating admission controller like the same bouncer giving hats to customer that want to join a hat-only party but didn’t bring their hat.

<figure>

  <img
    src="/static/images/admission-webhook/bouncer-hat.webp"
    alt="A bouncer adding a hat to customer before they get in a hat-only party"
    width="460"
    height="460"
  />
</figure>

Those customers get “mutated” with a red hat, before they get in. Now they look cool.

Now, it’s unlikely someone (you, me) would ever write an admission controller: admission controllers are written in GO, and compiled with the kube-apiserver.
You may activate / desactive the admission controllers availables.
The full list is available here https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do
Among this list, two are very important for us today:
`MutatingAdmissionWebhook` and `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook`. Those controller calls mutating or validating webhook, and that webhook is what we are going to write.
It's easy, even I can do it.

## What are admission webhook?

Admission webhook are simple custom HTTP callback that are triggered by the Kubernetes API server when handling API requests.
In this blog, I will write a mutating admission webhook in python, that mutates the CPU requests of pods. Unlike admission controllers,
that are part of the kube-apiserver, and written in Go language, admission webhook can be written in any languages, and are pretty straightforward.
It just need to provide an API endpoint, and manipulate jsons. Too easy!.

The requests receive on the endpoint /mutate/ is a JSON `AdmissionReview`. For a pod creation, it will look like:

```JSON
{
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1beta1",
  "request": {
    "uid": "0df28fbd-5f5f-11e8-bc74-36e6bb280816",
    "kind": {
      "group": "",
      "version": "v1",
      "kind": "Pod"
    },
    "namespace": "dummy",
    "operation": "CREATE",
    //...
    "object": { // the pod object
      "metadata": {
         //...
      },
      "spec": {
        // the pod spec, potentially defining some CPU requests
      },
      "status": {}
    },
  }
}
```

If the pod defines a single container, and no initContainer, the respons will look like

```JSON
{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "response": {
    "uid": "0df28fbd-5f5f-11e8-bc74-36e6bb280816",
    "allowed": true,
    "patchType": "JSONPatch",
    "patch": [
      {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/spec/containers/0/resources/requests",
        "value": {
          "cpu": "0.001"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# Why writting a cpu request mutating webhook?

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand if you want to know more about the why. No code in this section</summary>

I am running a small OpenShift Lab cluster, with limited CPU and Memory. Everytime I install an Operator, such as GitOps, ACS, ACM,
those operators request a certain amount of CPU and Memory for some of it's pod. The request is a guaranteed amount of resource
for the pod, wether it's actually being used or not. There is a very good reason why those requests (and limits) are being made.
It guarantees that the pods will function correctly under moderate or heavy loads. However, say I have 16 CPU, and after installing
a few Operators, 16 CPU are already requested, there is no more resource available to schedule new workload with CPU requests, even
if the cluster is acually iddle, with say just 1 CPU being used. It's very quickly limiting for a "Lab" environment, which is why I wrote
this admission webhook. In doing so, I am responsable to monitor the CPU usage. Clearly, the mutating webhook will need to be configured
to ignore certain critical namespaces to protect critical resources such as etcd, api-server.

## Why not editing the deployments, statefullsets, and deamonsets instead?

Quite often, those resources are controlled by parent resources, and editing them may not stick. On the other hands, pods are usually
indirectly created by deployments, statefullsets, and deamonsets. Editing pods on the fly with a mutating webhook is perfectly fine. In fact,
it's a common strategy used to inject sidecar contaienrs in pod, as done by the Istio operator for example.

## Why not using the ClusterResourceOverride operator?

This is a great operator that can mutate the ratio between limits and requests. However, I needed something a bit more aggresive.
Besides, I anticipate I will need fine grain control at a later stage, and the ClusterResourceOverride only let specify one override resource
that will be applied to selected namespaces. But different namespace can't have different override resource.

## How about memory?

Unlike CPU, if a pod doesn't have the minimum requirement memory allocated, it will likely run out of memory. Think for example about a java
app with it's heap size requirements. It's much more dangerous to rewrite memory requests on the fly. I will probably do it at some points, but
I would need to be able to override memory request differently for various containers. A fine grain control I can managed in a later version of
my webhook.

## Why not just removing the CPU requests of the pod?

It's probably valide. I guess by seting the request to 0.001, I'll be able to infere that any pod with that value has been mutated by
my webhook.

# Writing and deploying the webhook in 5 easy steps.

1. Write the http api server. Very simple in Python, choose your prefered languages
2. Containerize this app. Simple too.
3. Write and deploy the deployment / services. Simple
4. Get some certificate. Those can be injected, so very easy
5. Configure the webhook with a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration

Let's get started.

# 1. Write the http api server.

I am using python because I am not very smart. Bright people should of course use clojure for an extra challenge.
The code should listen to POST requests on the /mutate path, parse the admissionReviewRequest, and return a ... admissionReviewRequest
that now include some patch statements. I am using the pydantic python library to parse the json requests, and the pupular fastAPI
to manage the API requests. Finally, uvicorn as an embedded webserver to serve the requests.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

class Container(BaseModel):
    name: str
    resources: dict = {}

class PodSpec(BaseModel):
    containers: list[Container]
    initContainers: list[Container] = []

class Pod(BaseModel):
    spec: PodSpec

class AdmissionReviewRequest(BaseModel):
    request: dict

class AdmissionReviewResponse(BaseModel):
    apiVersion: str
    kind: str
    response: dict

@app.post("/mutate")
async def mutate_pod(admission_review: AdmissionReviewRequest):
    pod = Pod(**admission_review.request["object"])

    patches = []

    # Function to add patch for a container
    def add_patch(container, index, container_type):
        if "requests" not in container.resources:
            patches.append({
                "op": "add",
                "path": f"/spec/{container_type}/{index}/resources/requests",
                "value": {"cpu": "0.001"}
            })
        else:
            patches.append({
                "op": "replace" if "cpu" in container.resources["requests"] else "add",
                "path": f"/spec/{container_type}/{index}/resources/requests/cpu",
                "value": "0.001"
            })

    # Modify the CPU requests to 0.001 for all containers
    for i, container in enumerate(pod.spec.containers):
        add_patch(container, i, "containers")

    # Modify the CPU requests to 0.001 for all initContainers
    for i, container in enumerate(pod.spec.initContainers):
        add_patch(container, i, "initContainers")

    # Construct the response
    response = {
        "uid": admission_review.request["uid"],
        "allowed": True,
        "patchType": "JSONPatch",
        "patch": patches
    }

    admission_review_response = {
        "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
        "kind": "AdmissionReview",
        "response": response
    }

    return AdmissionReviewResponse(**admission_review_response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

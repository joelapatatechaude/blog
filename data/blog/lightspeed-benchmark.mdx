# TL;DR

The **OpenShift LightSpeed** AI Assistant is ridiculously useful.
Even in its current tech preview phase, I’m already impressed.
OpenShift admins and users are going to love it.
For quick tests or lab environments, you can get it up and running in
minutes by connecting it to OpenAI’s cloud models - gpt-4o mini works perfectly well.
For disconnected clusters or environments where data can’t leave the premises,
adding a GPU to your cluster and deploying a local LLM is the way to go, and it's easy.
A well-trained 8-billion parameter conversational model is more than
sufficient, and **Granite 3.3-8B-Instruct** is my top pick at the time of writing.

# Introduction

AI assistants are a powerful way to boost productivity.
Yes, their answers still need cross-checking at times—but the pace of improvement is astonishing, and the productivity gains are already real.

In this post, I’ll share the results of a short, **unbiased** benchmark study that highlights how effective
OpenShift LightSpeed (the OpenShift AI Assistant) can be in troubleshooting scenarios.

Why is this benchmark unbiased? Because I created a set of hands-on OpenShift troubleshooting exercises about a year ago,
as a training asset for OpenShift users and admins.
Now that LightSpeed is available, I’m using the exact same scenarios to evaluate its capabilities. No retrofitting or tailored prompts.

The benchmark compares results across three different LLM providers.
LightSpeed itself needs an LLM backend, either cloud-hosted or self-managed, but thanks to its
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) integration with OpenShift documentation, no model retraining or fine-tuning is needed.

Here are the models I used:

- **OpenAI gpt-4o-mini**: Fast, powerful, affordable, and a leading option in the market. While OpenAI hasn’t disclosed the exact size of the model, it’s estimated to use ~8 billion parameters. It performed extremely well in this benchmark.

- **IBM Granite-3.3-8B-Instruct**: Fully open source and indemnified, two characteristics that appeal to organizations running LLMs in their own data centers. At 8 billion parameters, this model is a solid peer to gpt-4o mini. (Spoiler: it performs just as well.)

- **IBM Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct**: At 2 billion parameters, this model enters CPU-hosted territory. In my CPU tests, it's slow, too slow for a great user experience. But I included it (running on GPU) just to test whether small LLMs can still deliver good results. (Spoiler: not yet.).

What this benchmark is not:

- Not a speed or concurrency test. Both Granite models ran on a single GPU and were fast enough for single-user usage.

- Not a full LLM showdown. The goal is to showcase LightSpeed’s value even on smaller models, not rank every model on the market.

- Not a comparison of LLM servers solutions. I used the open-source vLLM server, where Red Hat (via Neural Magic) is now the top contributor. Quantization support is still maturing, and other servers might be better for large quantized models.

- Not biased. All troubleshooting scenarios were written long before LightSpeed was released. Prompts were initially tested with gpt-4o mini, so it may have a slight edge—but identical prompts were used across all models.

- Not covering all of LightSpeed’s capabilities. This post focuses on troubleshooting. While LightSpeed also answers general OpenShift questions and generates kubernetes YAML resources effectively, that’s outside the scope here.

# Benchmark protocol

This benchmark is based on six troubleshooting exercises (or "tests") that I created over a year ago as part of
a hands-on workshop to help OpenShift users learn how to diagnose and resolve issues.
You can access the full workshop—including instructions, hints, and solutions—here: https://trbl-workshop.cszevaco.com/workshop.

With a good understanding of both how LightSpeed and OpenShift work, and as the original author of the workshop,
I crafted a consistent set of questions to ask the AI assistant.
The answers were assessed based on their accuracy and effectiveness in helping resolve the problem.

For this benchmark,

- I used OpenShift LightSpeed Operator in version 0.3.3, still in tech preview at time of writing. Running on OpenShift 4.18.5
- I used vLLM version: 0.8.4 with GPU support (event for Granite 3.3-2b model)
- The chat history was cleared between each test to avoid context issues.

The table below summarizes the six tests, the context provided
(such as Kubernetes resource YAML, pod logs, and resource events),
the prompts used, and the expected answers.
Note that LightSpeed needs some context (YAML, logs...) to provide troubleshooting guidances specific to the problem at hand.

That's the one you would want to dive a bit more first if needed.
